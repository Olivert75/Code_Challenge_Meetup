    "#### What is Classification?\n",
    "Classification is a Supervised Machine Learning technique. Classification, like Regression, uses labeled data from a training dataset to learn rules for making future predictions on unseen data. However, Classification is used to predict the category membership of the categorical target value or label. For Classification algorithms, you determine the probability of an observation to be part of a certain class or not. Therefore, you express the probability with a value between 0 and 1. A probability close to 1 means the observation is very likely to be part of a group or category.\n",
